ChatGPT uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target='_blank' title=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/machine-learning/gpt-4-and-chatgpt-update\" href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/machine-learning/gpt-4-and-chatgpt-update\">GPT-4</a>), while Bard uses the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target='_blank' title=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/\" href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/\">LaMBDA</a>). Also, ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.</p><p>In terms of capabilities, both do very similar things. Programmers can use ChatGPT for:</p><ul><li><div><p><strong>Suggestions: </strong>Both models can suggest the correct syntax and parameters for functions and other code constructs.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Completion: </strong>It can complete code that you have started writing.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Debugging:</strong>\u00a0It can help you identify errors and problems in your code.</p></div></li><li><div><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>\u00a0It can explain the code that it generates, or code you input.</p></div></li></ul><p>Both models were trained on a massive dataset, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, books, articles, documents, and content scraped from the internet. However, Bard is a little different in that it was trained on conversations and dialogues from the web, while ChatGPT was trained mostly on scraped general content.</p><p>Both products are still under development, Bard a bit more so than ChatGPT. But to really show how these differences actually matter in a practical sense, here\u2019s how they work when tested against each other.</p><h2>Testing ChatGPT and Bard against each other</h2><p>We chose seven categories to test the chatbots against each other, based on what we felt were the most relevant:\u00a0code generation,\u00a0problem solving,\u00a0refactoring code,\u00a0debugging assistance,\u00a0third-party plugins/UI extension,\u00a0ease of use, and\u00a0cost. Let&#39;s preface this by saying this is not a rigorous scientific comparison, but rather a handful of tests mixed with our hands-on experience to date.</p><h3>1. Code generation</h3><p>The bread and butter of what we want it for, right?

Lawmakers usually thought incapable of reconciling even the smallest of differences are finding rare common ground over a shared mistrust of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a mutual disdain for domestic spying.</p><p>At a committee hearing Wednesday, US Representative Zoe Lofgren of California called out the FBI&#39;s director, Christopher Wray, over a disclosure he\u2019d reluctantly made in March: Not long ago, he said, the FBI had circumvented the need to obtain search warrants by buying commercial data that revealed the whereabouts of an unknown number of Americans. Buying this data, rather than compelling its disclosure, allowed the FBI to forgo asking a judge\u2019s permission\u2014a requirement as of 2018, thanks to the Supreme Court decision <em>Carpenter v. United States.</em></p><p>Disturbed by this revelation, Lofgren\u2014a 14-term Democrat and leader of past efforts to curb government surveillance on US soil\u2014used the hearing to take a deeper interest in Wray\u2019s claim that the data was originally collected for advertising purposes. Wray showed resistance to revealing anything new, saying only that the deal was legal and that his staff would follow up with Lofgren; that way, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t leave something important out.\u201d</p><p>With limited time, Lofgren moved on to other concerns.

Many of the questions that top Republicans put to Wray on Wednesday were seemingly designed to lend credence to these theories.

Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado noted that Wray\u2019s Wikipedia page lists him as a registered Republican. \u201cI hope,&quot; he said, &quot;you don\u2019t change your party affiliation after this hearing is over.\u201d</p><p>One of the farthest-right members in the House, Gaetz took his turn questioning Wray immediately after Lofgren. His first words were in her defense. \u201cThe American people need to understand what just happened,\u201d he railed. \u201cMy Democratic colleague just asked the director of the FBI whether or not they are buying information about our fellow Americans, and the answer is, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just have to get back to you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>In an exchange overheard by an Associated Press reporter present for the hearing, Gaetz also heaped praise on another political rival moments after she, too, laid into the director.

Intelligence agencies collect this data, nevertheless, the report states, using a legal theory that paying for it removes any need to obtain a search warrant.</p><p>Privacy experts at digital rights groups, including Demand Progress and the American Civil Liberties Union, consider this practice a legal loophole at odds with the US Constitution&#39;s goal of protecting against unlawful searches and seizures. Many lawmakers, including Jayapal and Lofgren, feel similarly.</p><p>Wray went on to explain that his story had not changed since he <a title=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-purchase-location-data-wray-senate/\" href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-purchase-location-data-wray-senate/\">first disclosed the purchases in March</a> and that the FBI was not actively purchasing location data at this moment. It is unclear what exactly became of the data it did purchase or how it was used, if at all. The FBI has said the data was collected by private companies for advertising purposes and that it was acquired by the government for a vague \u201cpilot project.\u201d An FBI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The protection of location and web browsing data were not the only concern raised by lawmakers Wednesday. Republican Thomas Massie would also pepper Wray with questions about another FBI request for \u201cgun purchase records\u201d reportedly issued to a major US bank. The records, Massie claimed, had \u201cno geographical boundaries,\u201d meaning the request was likely not limited to a particular area, city, or state.</p><p>Wray resisted the questions, as he had for most of the hearing. \u201cWhat I do know,\u201d the director said, \u201cis that a number of business community partners all the time\u2014including financial institutions\u2013share information with us about possible criminal activity.\u201d Massie then asked Wray to clarify whether the bank had volunteered the data or whether the FBI had requested it first.</p><p>Wray declined to respond to the question, saying he could not \u201cspeak to specifics.\u201d</p><p>Wray was not entirely opposed to the idea of bettering privacy protections for at least some Americans. Law enforcement officers, he noted, face threats of violence every day as a result of being doxed online. \u201cThe more information, personalized information, about law enforcement professionals that is on the internet, the more people who may be unstable or inclined to violence there are out there who can choose to act on it,\u201d he said.</p>"}}, {"slug": "celsius-founder-alex-mashinskys-arrest-wont-fix-crypto", "title": "Celsius Founder Alex Mashinsky\u2019s Arrest Won\u2019t Fix Crypto", "id": "clk3589ft1dl10bsmhgxrgq0l", "createdAt": "14 Jul 2023", "description": "Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of collapsed crypto lender Celsius, faces seven fraud charges.

The DOJ complaint states that, while Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a \u201cmodern day bank,\u201d he instead operated the the company as \u201ca risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretenses and turning customers into unwitting investors in a business far riskier and far less profitable than what Mashinsky had represented.\u201d</p><p>The \u201clitany of charges,\u201d says Lisa Bragan\u00e7a, attorney at Bragan\u00e7a Law and ex-branch chief at the SEC, will be \u201cdevastating\u201d for Mashinsky. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot for the government to prove,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it only has to prove pieces\u201d to secure a significant jail sentence. It\u2019s also likely that prosecutors have obtained testimony from Celsius insiders, explains Bragan\u00e7a\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s big.\u201d</p><p>At word of Mashinsky\u2019s arrest, a number of Celsius creditors gathered in group channels on Telegram and elsewhere to celebrate: \u201cFuck yeah,\u201d wrote one creditor. \u201cI\u2019d love to see a perp walk,\u201d said another. But some were more reserved, pointing out that the arrest will do nothing to accelerate asset recoveries. \u201cI wish there was a way to make this madness end sooner,\u201d one channel member wrote.</p><p>Others have been left with an uncomfortable sense that crypto has not yet managed to clear its decks of bad actors and that, should another hype cycle arrive, the conditions that bred the likes of Celsius and FTX could recur. In short, that lessons have not necessarily been learned.</p><p>In particular, says Kling, the crypto industry remains vulnerable to hero worship\u2014a tendency to venerate the individuals that accrue the most money and command the greatest influence in the sector: like Mashinsky, Bankman-Fried, Do Kwon of Terra Luna, and Kyle Davies and Su Zhu of Three Arrows.</p><p>The charges leveled at Celsius and FTX\u2014of deceiving investors, commingling assets, and shuffling customer funds between subsidiaries\u2014are echoed by those brought since March by the CFTC and SEC against Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao.</p>"}}, {"slug": "why-is-europes-latest-heat-wave-called-cerberus-its-complicated", "title": "Why Is Europe\u2019s Latest Heat Wave Called Cerberus?

The society had nothing to do with the heat wave\u2019s dramatic christening. \u201cThe name is unofficial, and we absolutely don\u2019t use it,\u201d says Luca Mercalli, the society\u2019s president, adding that he finds it somewhat sensationalistic.</p><p>The name was actually chosen by Italian weather website iLMeteo specifically for the anticyclone, or high-pressure region, currently subjecting southern Europe to extreme heat\u2014a fact confirmed to WIRED by Antonio San\u00f2, iLMeteo\u2019s founder.</p><p>San\u00f2 shrugs off the accusation that Cerberus could be considered histrionic. \u201cOur names are not official but always become quickly famous, thanks to our popularity,\u201d he says. iLMeteo\u2019s habit of naming anticyclones after mythological figures is the reason the heat wave that struck Europe in 2017 became widely referred to as Lucifer\u2014a name for the planet Venus in Roman folklore that also came to be used for the devil in Christian tradition.</p><p>The confusion over what to call 2023\u2019s European heat wave descends still deeper, like Dante\u2019s many circles of hell, because in the Spanish city of Seville, the heat wave <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" class=\"external-link\" target='_blank' title=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2023/07/09/heat-wave-xenia-sevilla/\" href=\"https://onebillionresilient.org/2023/07/09/heat-wave-xenia-sevilla/\">has been dubbed Xenia.</a> The Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock), in collaboration with the University of Seville and the City of Seville, launched its own heat wave naming system last year. This is the third time the organization has deployed it. The system runs in reverse alphabetical order and uses recognizably Spanish names\u2014but ones that are not overly common, so as to keep them notable.</p><p>And don\u2019t forget that Berliner Wetterkarte (a meteorological nonprofit) and the Free University of Berlin have been naming high- and low-pressure weather events in Europe since 1954. The anticyclone FEE is bringing sunny weather to Germany at the moment, says Petra Gebauer, chair of Berliner Wetterkarte. She explains that groups of meteorologists around Europe sometimes give their own names to heat waves. \u201cActually, the southeastern group has the name Cleon for the heat wave in Greece,\u201d she explains, adding that she hadn\u2019t known how the name Cerberus emerged.</p><p>The plethora of sobriquets may seem peculiar, but this shouldn\u2019t detract from the danger posed by the present heat in southern Europe. On July 11, a man in his forties collapsed and died in Italy while working outdoors, according to local media, and there have been multiple reports of heatstroke in the country. In Spain, temperatures have hit 45 degrees Celsius in some places, and a new helpline for people affected by heat has received 54,000 calls since it went live last month. Just days ago, scientists published <a title=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z\">a study in which they estimated</a> that nearly 62,000 people died in Europe as a result of extreme summer heat last year.</p>"}}, {"slug": "the-hollywood-actors-walkout-will-change-how-we-fight-ai", "title": "The Hollywood Actors' Walkout Will Change How We Fight AI", "id": "clk34ggi61f0f0bu19ud2mwwp", "createdAt": "14 Jul 2023", "description": "Meryl Streep and other outspoken individuals may help artificial intelligence reach a new level of awareness, along with the suspension of production.", "richText": {"html": "<p>When the Matrix co-creator disapproves of your artificial intelligence strategy, you KNOW IT&#39;S terrible. Lilly Wachowski tweeted a series of reasons why she was voting against the Directors Guild of America&#39;s union deal with Hollywood studios in June. The AI provision in the contract, which states that generative AI cannot be regarded as a &quot;person&quot; or carry out tasks typically performed by DGA members, was insufficient. &quot;We need to change the language to imply that we won&#39;t use AI in any department, on any show we work on,&quot; said the speaker. &quot;I firmly believe the struggle we [are] going through in our industry right now is a microcosm of a much more serious and pressing crisis.&quot; </p><p>When the Screen Actors Guild\u2014American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) went on strike on Thursday, that crisis reached yet another significant turning point. One of the greatest issues involved AI, similar to the Writers Guild of America, which is also on strike. Before the strike, a SAG member told the outlet that actors were starting to view the &quot;Joan Is Awful&quot; episode of Black Mirror as a &quot;documentary of the future&quot; and another said that studios like Warner Bros., Netflix, Disney, Apple, Paramount, and others &quot;can&#39;t pretend we won&#39;t be used digitally or become the source of new, cheap, AI-created content.&quot;</p><p>I wrote about the WGA strike&#39;s similarities to the labor movement of the Luddites a few weeks ago. Similar to the Luddites, authors are concerned about emerging automation taking their work but aren&#39;t outright anti-tech. AI technologies could serve a purpose without endangering anyone&#39;s livelihood if they could be utilized to assist writers\u2014for example, to come up with new names for a sci-fi planet. It would be one thing if big language models could be taught to authors as tools. The WGA contends that this is a problem if they are employed in place of authors or to write scripts that humans must then correct for less money. In the end, they want a say in how AI is applied to the production of movies.</p>"}}, {"slug": "in-the-us-ev-sales-set-a-record-perhaps-now-their-popularity-is-dwindling", "title": "In the US, EV sales set a record.

This increase occurs despite the fact that several car models are no longer eligible for federal and some state incentives.</p><p>Between the beginning of April and the end of June, consumers purchased roughly 300,000 EVs, according to analysts at Wards Intelligence and Cox Automotive. This includes growth in May and June, the first two months following stricter federal tax credit restrictions, and represents an increase of about 50% year over year. Sales of plug-in hybrids increased as well.</p><p>According to Christie Schweinsberg, a sustainability expert at Wards, &quot;There are some vehicles that are intriguing enough to buyers that you don&#39;t need a rebate.&quot; She makes note of the constantly expanding selection of EVs and alternatives available to customers. &quot;People will continue to want to purchase.&quot;</p><p>However, there are indications that the rapid rate of sales growth might not continue. Dealer inventories of internal combustion vehicles had, on average, a 53-day supply at the end of June, according to Cox. On the other hand, the inventory runway for EVs was more than twice as large. In comparison to around 20,000 a year earlier, there were more than 92,000 electric vehicles available overall in the second quarter.</p><p>The demand for electric vehicles is not keeping up with supply, which is the opposite of what was happening a year ago, according to Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive. &quot;It is referred to as the &#39;Field of Dreams&#39; moment. Although automakers are producing more vehicles, not enough people are buying them.</p><p>Krebs attributes the glut to both a post-pandemic boost in production and traditional consumer hesitations about buying electric vehicles. Price, she says, is the primary barrier among buyers that <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" class=\"external-link\" target='_blank' title=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/as-more-americans-choose-evs-price-and-range-continue-to-hold-back-the-market-according-to-new-cox-automotive-study/\" href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/as-more-americans-choose-evs-price-and-range-continue-to-hold-back-the-market-according-to-new-cox-automotive-study/\">Cox surveys</a>, because EVs remain generally more expensive than a similar gas-powered model. Concerns about charging infrastructure is another reason would-be-owners stay on the sidelines.</p><p>According to Krebs, the environment for electric vehicle incentives has also grown more complex. Numerous models were eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 at this time last year, and numerous cities and states also provided additional incentives. Since then, some states have run out of funding for their rebate programs, including Oregon and New Jersey. The manufacturing criteria created by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress approved last year, are intended to encourage automakers to invest in US production facilities and battery supply chains. The list of models eligible for a tax credit has been drastically reduced as a result of the law, at least temporarily.</p><p>According to Michael Stewart, a representative for Hyundai, whose vehicles were removed from the government list because they no longer adhere to the new standards, &quot;We certainly see an impact because of it.&quot; Even though all of Hyundai&#39;s EV models saw an increase in sales despite losing the credit, he thinks that without it, the company&#39;s and the nation&#39;s ambitious EV sales targets could have been reached even more quickly.</p><p>However, sales of the Hyundai Kona and the BMW i4, which are also ineligible for federal tax subsidies, nearly tripled. Market leader Tesla reported a 76 percent increase in sales of its well-liked Model Y as a result of recently regaining access to tax subsidies.</p><p>The average cost of an electric vehicle has decreased by about 20%, to $53,438 in the past year alone, as businesses attempt to combat the EV headwinds. The Inflation Reduction Act has a flaw that manufacturers have taken advantage of to claim a credit on automobiles they lease rather than buy. According to Stewart, Hyundai has been particularly aggressive in advertising leases, which have increased from making up about 5 percent of the vehicles the business sells off the lot to nearly 30 percent.</p><p>Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Hyundai and other businesses declared their intentions to increase the production of electric vehicles in the US and increase domestic sourcing of battery components. One factor, says Schweinsberg, is that there is often a decline in sales within a year or two of a new model being introduced\u2014a threshold some EVs are reaching. \u201cTypically it does well when the new generation comes out,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s probably too early to tell exactly what the trajectory for electric vehicles might look like.</p><p>Krebs forecasts that EV sales will increase going forward, albeit &quot;maybe not at the pace that a lot of people had hoped for.&quot; She doesn&#39;t find that particularly unexpected given the significant change the sector is seeking to achieve.</p><p>She claims that this is the largest shift in the sector since Henry Ford introduced his mobile assembly line. &quot;There will be hiccups in the road.&quot;</p>"}}, {"slug": "ok-surfers-how-much-would-it-cost-to-power-your-own-wave", "title": "OK Surfers, How Much Would It Cost to Power Your Own Wave?", "id": "clk48jv2m2as40bu0vzv2puql", "createdAt": "15 Jul 2023", "description": "How much energy would it take to fuel a wave that you can shred like Kelly Slater?

Making an artificial wave machine starts with a body of water. In this case, it&#39;s basically a rectangular pond.
